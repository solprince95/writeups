## 🧪 What I Worked On

### 1️⃣ Offensive Security Introduction
- 🔍 Loved the quote: “To outsmart a hacker, you need to think like one.”
- ✅ Simulated an attack on a fake virtual bank using *Gobuster*
- 🎯 Learned the mindset of ethical hacking

---

### 2️⃣ Defensive Security Introduction
- 🛡️ Learned about user awareness, asset management, and documentation
- 🔁 Introduced to:
  - Security Operations Center (SOC)
  - Threat Intelligence
  - Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)
  - Malware Analysis (Static & Dynamic) — totally new to me!
- 🧪 Hands-on: Used a simulated SIEM tool to detect & block a suspicious IP
- 💡 My favorite part: actively experiencing the defensive side

---

### 3️⃣ Networking Basics
- 🌐 Learned history of the Internet, IP addressing (IPv4 vs IPv6), MAC addresses
- ⚠️ Practical: Performed a basic spoofing demo

---

### 4️⃣ DNS in Detail
- 🧠 Learned DNS hierarchy and record types: A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT
- 🛠️ Practical: Queried DNS records and found:
  - CNAME
  - TXT
  - MX record with numerical priority

---

### 🐧 Linux Fundamentals
- Explored basic Linux commands and terminal navigation
- Got comfortable using CLI in cybersecurity contexts

---

## 📝 Key Takeaways
- Cybersecurity involves both attackers and defenders
- Practical experience builds confidence — not just theory
- Tools like Gobuster and SIEM systems are powerful
- I’m excited to dive deeper into real labs and CTFs
